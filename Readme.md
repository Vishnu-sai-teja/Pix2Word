## Pix2Word 

 - In this project I would implement a **Vision Language Model** .

### Agenda
- **Vision Transformer** - to extract infrormation from th image
- **CLIP , SigLip** - Training of the vision transformer using **Contrastive Liearning** 
- **Gemma** -  Langauge Model  
- Combining the embeddings of the vision model and the langauge model 
- **KV Cache** - Optimized and best way to perform inference
- **Rotary Positional Encoding** - For langage model encoder
- **Normalization** - Batch , layer , RMS normalizations 

 ### Vision language Model
 - Language model that can extract information from the image 
 - The vision language model takes the **Image + Prompt** as input and generates the prompt or a response to the prompt from the context of the image
